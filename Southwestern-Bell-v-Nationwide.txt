United States District Court, W.D. Arkansas, Hot Springs Division

371 F. Supp. 900 (W.D. Ark. 1974)

SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY, A CORPORATION, PLAINTIFF,
V.
NATIONWIDE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORY SERVICE, INC., A CORPORATION, ET
AL., DEFENDANTS.

OPINION

OREN HARRIS, Chief Judge.

This is an action for copyright infringement and unfair competition.
Plaintiff first charges that defendants have copied, in a telephone
directory published by defendants, listings and art work from
plaintiff's copyrighted telephone directory in violation of the
Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U.S.C.A. s. 1 et seq.  Plaintiff's second
cause of action sounds in unfair competition and challenges defendant's
use of the phrase "Yellow Pages" and the duplication of plaintiff's
claimed Yellow Pages trade-mark in the directory published by
defendants.  Damages and injunctive relief are prayed for.

Plaintiff is a Missouri corporation and is authorized to do business as
a public utility in Arkansas.  It is one of the Bell System operating
companies and provides local and long distance service to many
communities in Arkansas and in other states.  Defendant, Nationwide
Independent Directory Service, Inc., is a Texas corporation which has
not been authorized to do business in Arkansas.  Individual defendants
Dan A. Smith and his wife, Marty Smith, are residents of Hot Springs,
Garland County, Arkansas.  The Smiths are the sole officers, directors,
stockholders and employees of Nationwide.

This Court has jurisdiction by virtue of 28 U.S.C.A. s. 1338(a)
which grants to district courts original and exclusive jurisdiction
over civil actions arising under the copyright statute and over any
substantial and related claim for unfair competition which has been
joined with the statutory claim.

The cause has been tried to the Court and has been submitted upon
the proof taken at the hearing on plaintiff's motion for preliminary
injunction held June 5, 1973, and the hearing on the merits held
November 9, 1973, the pleadings, certain stipulations of counsel,
interrogatories, depositions, numerous exhibits and written briefs.
This opinion incorporates the Court's findings of fact and conclusions
of law as authorized by Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.

COPYRIGHT VIOLATION

Plaintiff, as part of its service offering, annually publishes and
distributes telephone directories to its customers in its Little
Rock telephone exchange, comprised of Little Rock, North Little
Rock and certain surrounding suburban areas.  These directories have
been copyrighted since 1919.  The directory which plaintiff claims
defendant has copied was published by plaintiff in March 1972 for the
use of its customers in the Little Rock exchange for the remainder
of 1972 and the first months of 1973.

The first part of the directory is printed on white paper and lists
in alphabetical order the names, addresses and telephone numbers of
each of plaintiff's customers in the Little Rock exchange.  The second
part of the directory is printed on yellow paper and lists business
customers alphabetically under appropriate business classifications.
It also contains classified advertisements of differing sizes purchased
by business customers under their business classifications.

The directory is 11 x 9 inches in size and about 1 1/2 inches thick.
It contains approximately 1,000 pages.  The top half of the directory's
front cover displays a picture of the North Little Rock Community
Center. 1The bottom half of the cover bears the title "Little Rock ---
North Little Rock and suburban areas."  In the lower right hand corner
of the cover there appears the logo which plaintiff alleges to be its
Yellow Pages trade-mark.  The logo consists of a square colored black
within which there is pictured a telephone receiver over an open book
colored yellow.  Across the book there is printed the words "Yellow
Pages" in black.  The lower left corner of the cover shows the Bell
System logo, a circle with a bell in the center to the right of which
is printed Southwestern Bell.  At the bottom of the inside cover is
printed "04494 Copyright 1972 by Southwestern Bell Telephone Company."
A copyright notice is also printed on every page.

The proof shows the compilation, production and distribution of
the 45 directories which plaintiff publishes for the Little Rock
exchange and the other 44 exchanges plaintiff operates in Arkansas
involves highly specialized work and that great care is taken to
assure the accuracy of the listings contained therein.  The cost
for production and distribution of the 45 directories plaintiff
published in Arkansas in 1972 approximated $1,467,000.  About 40%
of this figure, or $585,000, represented the cost for the "Little
Rock --- North Little Rock and suburban areas" directory.

We will now describe the telephone directory published by defendants.
This directory is 9 x 6 inches in size and 3/8 inches thick.
It contains 206 pages.  The front cover bears the title "North
Little Rock and Suburban Areas Telephone Directory" across the top.
Below this is a picture of an Ozark mountain spring.  In the lower
right hand corner is printed the same Yellow Pages logo which appears
on plaintiff's directory.  Defendant's directory is also divided into
two sections.  The alphabetical section, printed on white paper, lists
names, addresses and telephone numbers of persons residing in North
Little Rock.  The classified section, printed on yellow paper, lists
North Little Rock businesses under the appropriate business headings.
It also contains business advertising.  The publisher's name does not
appear on the directory cover.  However, on page 3 the name "Nationwide
Independent Directory Service, Inc." appears as the publisher.

The testimony discloses defendants sold classified advertising in
their directory to a number of North Little Rock business firms during
the first part of 1972.  Defendants received approximately $8,500 in
advertising revenues from their directory and expended approximately
$7,500 for its compilation, printing and distribution to residents
of North Little Rock.

Plaintiff introduced into evidence the copyright certificate of
registration issued by the United States copyright office for its
1972 Little Rock --- North Little Rock and suburban areas directory.
This certificate names plaintiff as author of the directory and
consequently, plaintiff is entitled to a prima facie presumption
of originality. 17 U.S.C.A. s. 209; Drop Dead Co. v. S.C. Johnson
Son, Inc., 326 F.2d 87, 92 (9th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377
U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 1167, 12 L.Ed.2d 177.  Also the certificate of
registration constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity of
plaintiff's copyright and defendants have the burden of overcoming
this presumption.  Flick Reedy Corp. v. Hydroline Mfg. Co., 351 F.2d
546 (7th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 958, 86 S.Ct. 1222, 1223,
16 L.Ed.2d 301.

Defendants challenge plaintiff's copyright, taking the position
that telephone directories by reason of the public nature of their
content cannot be copyrighted.  This contention is without merit.
The copyright law specifically states that directories may be
copyrighted. 17 U.S.C.A. ss. 3, 5 and 7.  Moreover, the case law is
well settled that telephone directories, as well as other similar
compilations, are copyrightable and that suits for copyright
infringement will lie when such compilations are copied without
consent. 18 Am.Jur.2d Copyright and Literary Properties s. 46;
18 C.J.S.  Copyright and Literary Property s. 29; Nimmer, Nimmer on
Copyright s. 41 (1973).

The landmark case on copyright infringement of a telephone directory is
Leon v. Pacific Tel. Tel. Co., 91 F.2d 484 (9th Cir. 1937).  In that
case, Leon published a directory which was prepared by taking the
information contained in Pacific's San Francisco telephone directory
and rearranging it according to telephone numbers in numerical order
followed by the subscriber's name.  Pacific brought suit for temporary
and permanent injunctions, damages and costs alleging violation
of its copyright.  The trial court entered judgment for Pacific.
On appeal the court concluded that a telephone directory may be
copyrighted.  In doing so it quoted the following from Jeweler's
Circular Pub. Co. v. Keystone Pub. Co., 281 F. 83 at 88, cert. denied,
259 U.S. 581, 42 S.Ct. 464, 66 L.Ed. 1074:

The right to copyright a book upon which one has expended labor in
its preparation does not depend upon whether the materials which he
has collected consist or not of matters which are publici juris, or
whether such materials show literary skill or originality, either in
thought or in language, or anything more than industrious collection.
The man who goes through the streets of a town and puts down the names
of each of the inhabitants, with their occupations and their street
number, acquires material of which he is the author.  He produces
by his labor, a meritorious composition, in which he may obtain a
copyright, and thus obtain the exclusive right of multiplying copies
of his work.  Id., 91 F.2d at 486

Other cases supporting the conclusion reached by the court in Leon
are Cincinnati and Surburban Bell Tel. Co. v. Brown, 44 F.2d 631
(D.C.S.D.Ohio 1930); Southern Bell Tel. Tel. Co. v. Donnelly,
35 F. Supp. 425 (D.C.S.D.Fla. 1940); Consumers Union of U.S.,
Inc. v. Hobart Mfg. Co., 189 F. Supp. 275 (D.C.S.D.N Y 1960),
and Donald v. Zack Meyer's TV Sales and Service, 426 F.2d 1027 (5th
Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 992, 91 S.Ct. 459, 27 L.Ed.2d 441.
It has also been specifically held that copying of a portion of
a telephone directory in order to prepare a separate directory
for a town included in the directory constitutes infringement.
Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Tel. Co. v. Brown, supra; see also
Markham v. A.E. Borden Co., 206 F.2d 199 (1st Cir. 1953).

Defendants next contend plaintiff's copyright, if originally valid,
is now invalid because a third party has published a "Criss Cross"
directory for the cities of Little Rock and North Little Rock which
contains the same listing information except in a different format.
This contention is likewise without merit.  It is true that a copyright
may be abandoned.  Hampton v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 279 F.2d 100
(9th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 882, 81 S.Ct. 170, 5 L.Ed.2d
103.  However, in order to effect an abandonment, the proprietor must
intend to surrender his right and this must be manifested by some
overt act.  Hampton v. Paramount Pictures Corp., supra; Imperial Homes
Corp. v. Lamont, 458 F.2d 895 (5th Cir. 1972); Anno. 84 A.L.R.2d 464.
No such overt act on the part of plaintiff has been proven in this
case.  Moreover, the "Criss Cross" directory was not introduced into
evidence and there was no proof how the listings contained in that
directory were obtained.  It should be made clear here that plaintiff's
copyright does not extend to the individual names and addresses
listed in its directory, but rather to the compilation of the same.
There is nothing to stop another compiler obtaining this information,
which is in the public domain, by independent research.  To quote 18
Am.Jur.2d Copyright and Literary Property s. 118 at page 405:

A compiler of a directory cannot acquire by a copyright a monopoly
of the matter published, so as to preclude another from compiling a
copyrightable directory along similar lines, where such subsequent
compiler investigates and determines for himself the matter to be
included from the original sources of information which are open
to all.

1What a subsequent compiler cannot do is copy from an already
copyrighted directory and thereby save himself the labor and expense
incurred by the prior compiler.  Leon v. Pacific Tel. Tel. Co.,
supra; Adventures in Good Eating v. Best Places to Eat, 131 F.2d 809
(7th Cir. 1942).

We now reach the factual issue whether defendants copied substantial
portions of plaintiff's directory.  Plaintiff offered evidence showing
that errors in the spelling of names and addresses which occurred
in plaintiff's directory were faithfully repeated in defendant's
directory.  These common errors create a prima facie case of copying.
Sub-Contractors Register v. McGovern's C B Manual, 69 F. Supp. 507
(D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1946); American Travel Hotel Directory Co. v. Gehring
Pub. Co., 4 F.2d 415 (D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1925).  In addition, plaintiff
offered specific proof of copying.  The testimony of Ms. LeNelle
Campbell, owner of the LeWay Composing Service of Ft. Worth,
Texas, reveals Dan A. Smith contracted with her in June 1972 for
the typesetting of defendant's directory.  To perform this function,
Mr. Smith furnished Ms. Campbell a copy of plaintiff's directory with
all the North Little Rock listings underscored.  Ms. Campbell copied
these listings in typesetting defendant's directory.

Plaintiff also introduced a series of exhibits showing that original
art work prepared by plaintiff and published as advertising in its
directory was duplicated in advertisements appearing in defendant's
directory.  Such advertisements are subject to copyright protection.
Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239, 23 S.Ct. 298,
47 L.Ed. 460 (1903); 18 C.J.S.  Copyright and Literary Property s. 101.
Defendants admit copying the art work, but allege it was permissible
because authority to do so had been granted by the advertisers.
This cannot constitute a justification without proof that plaintiff
has assigned reproduction rights to its advertisers.  Mr. Canada,
who heads plaintiff's directory operation, testified plaintiff,
as a matter of policy, does not make such assignments.

The Court finds and concludes from the evidence in this case that
defendants have, in fact, copied substantial portions of plaintiff's
1972 "Little Rock --- North Little Rock and suburban areas" telephone
directory and in so doing have infringed upon plaintiff's copyright.

Copyright infringement is a tort and all those who participate in
an infringement are jointly and severally liable.  Screen Gems
--- Columbia Music, Inc. v. Meltis Lebow Corp., 453 F.2d 552
(2d Cir. 1972); Turton v. United States, 212 F.2d 354 (6th
Cir. 1954); Ted Browne Music Co. v. Fowler, 290 F. 751 (2d
Cir. 1923). 1Officers or directors of a corporation guilty of
infringement are individually liable if personally participating in
the acts constituting infringement or if they are sole shareholders.
Hagemeyer v. Insect-O-Lite Co., Inc., 291 F.2d 696, 699 (6th
Cir. 1961); General Electric Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 93 F.2d
671, 674 (2d Cir. 1938), cert. denied, 303 U.S. 641, 58 S.Ct. 610,
82 L.Ed. 1101.  It is not necessary to pierce the corporate veil.
Int'l Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Landon, Inc., 336 F.2d 723, 728-729 (9th
Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 988, 85 S.Ct. 701, 13 L.Ed.2d
610; H.M. Kolbe Co. v. Shaff, 240 F. Supp. 588 (D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1965).
Consequently, the Court finds plaintiff is entitled to damages and
injunctive relief against all the defendants jointly and severally.

UNFAIR COMPETITION

We turn now to plaintiff's allegations that the use of the words
"Yellow Pages," the Yellow Pages logo, which we have previously
described, and the printing of classified advertising on yellow paper
in defendant's directory constitutes unfair competition which this
Court should enjoin.  Plaintiff's claim is grounded on defendant's
alleged infringement of a common law trade name and mark which have not
been federally registered.  Therefore, the substantive law of Arkansas
applies.  It is established that the Arkansas law of trade-marks,
trade names and unfair competition follows and is in accord with
the general law.  Shoppers Fair of Arkansas, Inc. v. Sanders Co.,
207 F. Supp. 718, 725 (W.D.Ark. 1962), aff'd, 328 F.2d 496 (8 Cir.),
Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Liberty Ins. Co. of Texas, 185 F. Supp. 895,
903 (E.D.Ark. 1960).

1As a preface to the evaluation of this phase of plaintiff's case,
it will be well to bear in mind that the law of trade-marks is but a
part of the broader law of unfair competition and that the term "unfair
competition" in a case of this nature means a course of dealing which
leads, or is likely to lead, consumers into believing that the goods or
services of one supplier are those of another.  Hanover Star Milling
Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 412, 36 S.Ct. 357, 60 L.Ed. 713 (1916);
Seven Up Co. v. Cheer Up Sales Co. of St. Louis, Mo., 148 F.2d 909
(8th Cir. 1945); 87 C.J.S. Trade-Marks, Etc. s. 13. Trade-marks and
trade names are protected against use or limitation on the grounds
of unfair competition, and in resolving the issue of infringement
the same standard applies, that is, whether there is likelihood of
confusion among consumers.  Sweetarts v. Sunline, Inc., 380 F.2d 923,
927 (8th Cir. 1967) and cases cited therein.

A "trade-mark" is a name, sign or mark which one adopts to
denominate commercial goods originating from him.  It is, in effect,
a commercial signature. 87 C.J.S. Trade-Marks, Etc. s. 1; 3 Callman,
Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks s. 76.2(a), p. 1186 (2d Ed. 1950).
Generally, a "trade name" applies to the business and its good will
while a "trade-mark" applies to the commodity to which it is fixed.
American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, 269 U.S. 372, 380, 46 S.Ct. 160,
70 L.Ed. 317 (1926); Shoppers Fair of Ark., Inc. v. Sanders Co.,
supra.  It has been said that the law of trade names is identical
with that of trade-marks.  Any rights that may accrue in a trade
name is by reason of the fact that such trade name becomes in law,
a trade-mark.  Farmers Educational and C. Union v. Iowa Farmers Union,
150 F. Supp. 422 (D.C.S.D. Iowa 1957), aff'd, 250 F.2d 809 (8 Cir.),
cert. denied, 356 U.S. 976, 78 S.Ct. 1139, 2 L.Ed.2d 1149.

If a mark or name is arbitrary, unique, and distinct, it is
entitled to protection as a trade-mark as soon as it is employed.
Sweetarts v. Sunline, Inc., supra.  However, this does not mean that
the courts will not protect generic or descriptive marks and names
which cannot qualify as a technical trade-mark.  Property rights
in such can be acquired if "secondary meaning" is established.
Armstrong Paint and Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., 305 U.S. 315,
325, 59 S.Ct. 191, 83 L.Ed. 195 (1938).  The doctrine of secondary
meaning and its ramifications is succinctly explained in Liberty
Mutual Ins. Co. v. Liberty Ins. Co. of Texas, supra, 185 F. Supp. at
page 903 as follows:

"There are certain names, marks and symbols which in their primary
sense are merely generic or descriptive and do not ordinarily indicate
the origin of goods or services.  Such names, marks, or symbols,
when used in their primary sense, cannot form the subject matter
of a trade or service mark.  However, a name, mark, or symbol by
long and exclusive use and advertising by one person in the sale of
his goods and services may become so associated in the public mind
with such goods or services that it serves to identify them and
distinguish them from the goods or services of others.  When such
an association exists, the name, mark, or symbol is said to have
acquired a 'secondary meaning' in which the original user has a
property right which equity will protect against unfair appropriation
by a competitor.  Armstrong Paint Varnish v. Nu-Enamel Corp. [ 305
U.S. 315, 59 S.Ct. 191, 83 L.Ed. 195] supra; Katz Drug Co. v. Katz, 8
Cir., 188 F.2d 696; Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp. v. Kline, 8 Cir.,
132 F.2d 520; Beneficial Loan Corp. v. Personal Loan Finance Corp.,
D.C.Ark., 100 F. Supp. 838; 87 C.J.S. [Trade-Marks, Trade-Names and
Unfair Competition] supra, s. 90."

Having stated the law, we now will review the facts.  The proof shows
that for the past 40 years, plaintiff has printed the classified
advertising section of its telephone directory for the Little Rock
exchange on yellow paper and has called that section the "Yellow
Pages."  The 1941 directory is illustrative.  The classified section
is printed on yellow paper and contains an advertisement reading
"Looking for something, the Yellow Pages will tell you who sells it."
The Yellow Pages logo was first employed by plaintiff on the cover
of its 1961 directory for the Little Rock exchange.  This directory
likewise has the classified advertising section printed on yellow
paper and contains company advertisements such as "Find it fast in
the Yellow Pages."

The 1961 logo differs slightly from the one presently used.  It depicts
a telephone instrument in the lower left Hand corner of the square,
rather than the receiver across the top of the square.  The testimony
is that this alteration was made in 1964.

Plaintiff has extensively promoted the Yellow Pages in the Little
Rock metropolitan area for a number of years.  Plaintiff's Yellow
Pages advertising stresses two principal themes.  The general public
is urged to refer to the Yellow Pages because they contain valuable
shopping information and are easy to use.  Businessmen are urged to
purchase classified advertisements in the Yellow Pages in order to
increase sales.

In 1972, plaintiff ran 237 Yellow Pages commercials on Little Rock's
three television stations, 2085 commercials on 10 Little Rock radio
stations and 12 advertisements in three Little Rock newspapers.
In addition, a large number of Bell System Yellow Pages commercials
appeared on national television programs shown on the Little Rock
television stations and in national magazines which are circulated
in Little Rock.  To illustrate, in June 1972, seven commercials were
carried on such television shows as Cannon, C.B.S. Evening News,
Hawaii Five-O, C.B.S.  Thursday Night Movie and A.A.U. Track Meet.
Advertisements were printed in U.S. News and World Report, Advertising
Age, Sales Management, Fortune and Industrial Marketing.  In 1972,
plaintiff paid $48,902 to advertise the Yellow Pages in the Little
Rock metropolitan area and for the five year period from 1968 through
1972, plaintiff paid more than $230,000 for such advertising.

Two expert witnesses testified as to the impact of plaintiff's Yellow
Pages advertising on the public in the Little Rock area.  Mr. Gene
McCoy has had 22 years professional experience in advertising.
He has taught advertising at the University of Arkansas at Little
Rock for 12 years.  For the past 15 years he has been president of
a Little Rock advertising firm which does business in 22 states.
Mr. Ben Combs is a partner in a Little Rock advertising, marketing
and public relations firm which serves clients in a three state area.
Mr. Combs' qualifications as an expert were stipulated to.

Mr. McCoy and Mr. Combs testified, in their opinion, that because of
plaintiff's extensive advertising program, the phrase "Yellow Pages"
and the logo have become identified in the public's mind with the
classified advertising section of plaintiff's telephone directory.
Both also testified that, due to the similarity of plaintiff's and
defendant's directories, the public would, in their opinion, generally
believe defendant's directory was published by plaintiff.

1In the Court's opinion, the words "Yellow Pages" cannot, standing
alone, qualify as a technical trade-mark for the reason that they
literally describe the article upon which they are used; i.e.,
advertising printed on yellow pages.  In re W.A. Sheaffer Pen Co.,
158 F.2d 390, 34 CCPA (Patents) 771 (1946) --- "Fineline" pens; Keller
Products v. Rubber Linings Corp., 213 F.2d 382 (7th Cir. 1954) ---
"Tub-Kove" bathtub sealer; Griffin Mfg. Co. v. It Shoe Polish Co.,
80 F.2d 514 (4th Cir. 1935) --- "All White" shoe polish; Ralston
Purina Co. v. Thomas J. Lipton, Inc., 341 F. Supp. 129 (S.D.N.Y. 1972)
--- "Tender Vittles" cat food; 87 C.J.S. Trade-Marks, Etc. s. 33.
However, after weighing all the evidence in this case, the Court
is convinced that the public in the Little Rock marketing area has
come to identify the words "Yellow Pages" as a symbol signifying a
product coming from a single source, that is to say, the classified
advertising section of plaintiff's telephone directory.  In short,
the Court finds secondary meaning has been established.

Factors determining whether secondary meaning has attached in a
particular case include: (1) long use; (2) advertising; (3) sales
volume; and (4) identity of source or origin in the minds of the
purchasing public.  North American Airlines v. Civil Aeronautics Board,
97 U.S.App.D.C. 85, 228 F.2d 432 (1955); King Pharr Canning Operations
v. Pharr Canning Co., 85 F. Supp. 150 (W.D.Ark. 1949); Armstrong Paint
and Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., supra; 87 C.J.S. Trade-Marks,
Etc. s. 90. Plaintiff's proof satisfies all these tests.  For many
years it has published telephone directories for the Little Rock
exchange containing and advertising the Yellow Pages.  Hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of Yellow Pages classified advertising has
been purchased by businesses in Little Rock and North Little Rock.
Plaintiff has extensively advertised the Yellow Pages in newspapers,
radio, and television. 1The purchasing public uses the Yellow Pages
of plaintiff's directory to obtain information and, consequently,
cannot help but recognize that they are published by plaintiff.
In this circumstance, the descriptive term "Yellow Pages" becomes
a valid trade-mark which is entitled to protection.  To quote the
United States Supreme Court's landmark opinion in Armstrong Paint
Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., supra, 305 U.S. at page 335, 59
S.Ct. at page 201:

Here we have a secondary meaning to the descriptive term,
'Nu-Enamel.' This establishes, entirely apart from any trade-mark
act, the common law right of the Nu-Enamel Corporation to be free
from the competitive use of these words as a trade-mark or trade
name. [Citing cases]

See also, W.E. Bassett Co. v. Revlon, Inc., 435 F.2d 656 (2d
Cir. 1970); King Pharr Canning Operations v. Pharr Canning Co., supra;
1 Nims, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks s. 36 (1947); Restatement
of Torts s. 716(b).

The Court further finds that the Yellow Pages logo qualifies as
a technical trade-mark.  The question whether a trade-mark is
distinctively valid depends upon its elements as a whole, not
its dissected parts.  Although the logo contains the descriptive
words "Yellow Pages," the drawing of the spread open book with
the receiver above it, all contained within a square, creates a
distinctive mark.  Restatement of Torts s. 724; 87 C.J.S. Trade-Marks,
Etc. ss. 50, 53; Estate of P.D. Beckwith v. Comm'r of Patents,
252 U.S. 538, 40 S.Ct. 414, 64 L.Ed. 705 (1920); Ezee Stone Cutter
Mfg. Co. v. Southwest Indus. Prod., 262 F.2d 183 (8th Cir. 1959);
Cleo Syrup Corp. v. Coca-Cola Co., 130 F.2d 416 (8th Cir. 1944).
Furthermore, the Court finds the logo has an established secondary
meaning in the Little Rock area in that plaintiff has used it
conjunctively with the term "Yellow Pages" at all times.

Having determined that the words "Yellow Pages" and the logo constitute
valid trade-marks in which plaintiff possesses a property right,
we now reach the ultimate question --- whether there is a likelihood
of confusion on the part of those who may use defendant's directory.
To quote Sweetarts v. Sunline, Inc., supra:

"In resolving the issue of infringement, that is, in determining if the
prior user of a mark is entitled to protection against a subsequent
user, the test universally applied is whether there is a likelihood
of confusion among consumers. (Citing cases) Plaintiff need not show
actual confusion. (Citing cases) Nor need plaintiff show actual or
possible monetary injury. (Citing cases) 380 F.2d 923 at 926, 927

The issue of likelihood of confusion is one of fact for resolution
by the trial court.  Electronic Communications, Inc. v. Electronic
Components for Industry Co., 443 F.2d 487 (8th Cir. 1971),
cert. denied, 404 U.S. 833, 92 S.Ct. 80, 30 L.Ed.2d 63, and it is
said that "Ocular comparison of the tout ensemble is the best means
of determining the fact of deceptive and infringing imitation." 87
C.J.S. Trade-Marks, Etc. s. 68, p. 290.  Robinson Co. v. Plastics
Research Dev. Corp., 264 F. Supp. 852, 861 (W.D.Ark. 1967).

Comparison of plaintiff's and defendant's directories discloses both
contain white alphabetical pages and yellow classified advertising
pages.  Both display the Yellow Pages logo on the lower right corner
of the front cover.  Both directories contain numerous advertisements
in the classified section extolling the Yellow Pages and using the
logo.  For example, defendant has an ad reading "Yellow Pages, your
best advertising dollar."  Plaintiff has an ad that reads "Read and
acclaimed by millions, the Best Seller, the who's who of all ages.
The Yellow Pages."  Both directories advertise that "3.6 billion
times a year, people refer to the Yellow Pages."  Both directories
also repeatedly urge customers to "Let your fingers do the walking."
Plaintiff's directory carries its name "Southwestern Bell" on the front
cover.  Defendant's directory cover does not identify the publisher.
From its comparison, the Court has no hesitation in finding that
there exists the probability of a high degree of confusion on the
part of consumers due to the similarity of the two directories.

It is the duty of a subsequent trader coming into an established
trade to dress his goods in such a way as will not cause confusion
between his goods and that of a prior trader.  J.C. Penney
Co. v. H.D. Mercantile Co., 120 F.2d 949 (8th Cir. 1941);
87 C.J.S. Trade-Marks, Etc. s. 95.  Defendants have done just
the opposite.  Under these circumstances, it may be presumed that
defendants have deliberately simulated plaintiff's directory in order
to mislead the public and thereby benefit from plaintiff's established
reputation and good will.  It is also obvious, as Mr. Combs testified,
that defendants have copied plaintiff's trade-marks, in order to take
advantage of plaintiff's Yellow Pages promotional program in selling
classified advertising for their own directory.  Consequently, the
Court finds and concludes that defendants have infringed plaintiff's
Yellow Page trade-marks and have engaged in acts of unfair competition
in this case.  Hanson v. Triangle Publications, 163 F.2d 74 (8th
Cir. 1947), cert. denied, 332 U.S. 855, 68 S.Ct. 387, 92 L.Ed. 424.

The Court further concludes that defendants' use of yellow-colored
paper for the classified section of their directory should be enjoined
under the circumstances existing in this case.

Color by itself may not be a trade-mark, but a color used in
conjunction with other marks and/or in an arbitrary pattern can be
a valid trade-mark. 87 C.J.S. Trade-Marks, Etc. s. 47.  The instant
case is closely analogous to Eastman Kodak Co. v. Fotomat Corp.,
317 F. Supp. 304 (N.D.Ga. 1970) in which defendant was enjoined
from using yellow roofed kiosks.  The court found that an ocular
inspection of defendant's kiosks permitted a finding of likelihood
of confusion based on the "yellow roof, the words 'Kodak film' and
use of the colors yellow, red and black."  Consequently, the court
ordered the defendant to change the format and colors of its kiosks
to prevent customer confusion.  Plaintiff's directory format consists
of the logo, the words "Yellow Pages" and the yellow-colored pages.
The combination of these three elements has come to identify the origin
of plaintiff's directory and all should be protected as one unit to
prevent customer confusion.  87 C.J.S. Trade-Marks, Etc. s. 68, p. 290;
David Sherman Corp. v. Heublein, Inc., 340 F.2d 377 (8th Cir. 1965).

Defendants admit copying plaintiff's trade-marks but contend they
were free to do so because other telephone companies serving other
communities use the same marks in their directories.  Plaintiff's
witnesses testified that the Bell System and independent telephone
companies have an arrangement allowing mutual use of the marks.
However, this is all beside the point.  A trade-mark may acquire a
secondary meaning in one area, but lack such in another.  Liberty
Mutual Ins. Co. v. Liberty Ins. Co. of Texas, supra.  The relevant
marketing area here is the Little Rock metropolitan area and in this
area only plaintiff used the marks until defendants published their
directory.  Plaintiff's proof of secondary meaning and public confusion
was restricted geographically to the Little Rock metropolitan area
and the Court's findings are likewise so limited.  A trade-mark is
inseparable from the good will of the business of its possessor and
right to its exclusive use must be limited to the market wherein it
is established.  Shoppers Fair of Arkansas, Inc. v. Sanders Co., supra;
Beneficial Loan Corp. v. Personal Loan Finance Corp., 100 F. Supp. 838
(E.D.Ark. 1951); Griesedieck Western Brewery Co. v. People Brewing Co.,
149 F.2d 1019 (8th Cir. 1945).

REMEDY

The Court finds the equities in this cause are with the plaintiff and
that plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for in its complaint.

Plaintiff shall be granted a permanent injunction against defendants
individually and jointly enjoining them from infringing upon
plaintiff's copyrights in its directories heretofore published or
which may be published in the future.

The damages recoverable for infringement of copyright are established
by the Copyright Law, 17 U.S.C.A. s. 101(b).  This statute provides
three bases for computing the amount of recovery, the damages suffered
by the copyright owner, the profits made by the infringer and in
addition, or alternatively, statutory damages ranging from $250
minimum to $5,000 maximum.  The amount of damages to be awarded is
largely within the discretion of the trial court.  Peter Pan Fabrics
v. Jobela Fabrics, Inc., 329 F.2d 194 (2d Cir. 1964); F.W. Woolworth
Co. v. Contemporary Arts, 344 U.S. 228, 73 S.Ct. 222, 97 L.Ed. 276
(1952).

After taking into consideration all of the facts, the Court finds
plaintiff should be awarded $500.00 in damages for defendants'
copyright violation.  It is further adjudged that plaintiff should
recover its costs and attorney fees in the amount of $2,000.00 as
permitted by the Copyright Law.

Plaintiff shall also be granted a permanent injunction against
defendants individually and jointly enjoining them from use of
plaintiff's Yellow Pages logo, or any design or similar nature on
future directories published by them for the Little Rock metropolitan
area and also enjoining them from using the words "Yellow Pages"
or yellow paper in such directories in a manner that might cause the
public to believe defendant's directories originate from plaintiff.
Plaintiff has not prayed for damages with respect to unfair competition
allegations of its complaint and, consequently, none are awarded.

Let a decree be issued in accordance with this opinion.
